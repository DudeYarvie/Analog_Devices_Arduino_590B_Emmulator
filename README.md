# Analog_Devices_Arduino_590B_Emmulator
ADI/Linear Technologies offers an open-source "LinearLab Tools" set for using Python, MATLAB, LabVIEW, C, etc. to control a sizable set of Linear Technologies demo boards with the aid of a various USB to PC bridge controllers.  ADI provides the DC590B USB Serial Controller for low-speed DAC boards (e.g. LTC2642 16/14/12-bit Vout DAC).  At times the control boards are not available.  The LT DC2606 (Linduino) is built on the Atmega328 uC, just like the Arduino UNO board.  This repository provides the complete set of files to use the readily available Arduino UNO to emmulate the DC590B and DC2606 functionality.  These files are the exact files that come in the LinearLabTools set without edit.  Files were just pulled together into one repository so an Arduino UNO could build the code base.
